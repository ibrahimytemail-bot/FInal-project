Introdution:
            MY name is Ahmad. I am from pakistan and my city is faisalabad. I read in the final year of college. And I am 
student of ICS. I am reading in Punjab College. I am a web developer. My skills are HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Django, MongoDb, nodejs, react , express js  and next js. I have completed many projects on these technologies.

Problem: 
        We face a huge issue of fake products in our country. There are lots of fake products available in market. People often fall victim to these fake products. Also there are no websites for buying genuine products. People also don't know that what kind of product they are buying. They just want to save money but do not know about the quality of product they are buying . So i decided to make an online store where people can buy genuine products. I also wanted to give a platform to small businesses so that they can sell their products online. So i have made actually two versions of this project one is front end and other is back end. In front end you will find a website which has all the features like login, signup, add to cart, checkout etc. And in backend you will find a admin panel where you can manage your products, users, orders etc.
