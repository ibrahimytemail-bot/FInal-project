Here is all the complete guides for using virtual store

Introdution:
            My name is Ahmad. I am from pakistan and i belongs to faisalabad. I read in the final year of college and
student of ICS. I am studing in Punjab College. I am a web developer. My skills are HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Django, MongoDb, nodejs, react , express js and next js. I have completed many projects on these technologies.

Problem: 
We face a huge issue of fake products in our country. There are lots of fake products available in market. People often fall victim to these fake products. Also there are few websites for buying genuine products and often people dont know about those sites . People also don't know that what kind of product they are buying. They just want to save money but do not know about the quality of product they are buying . So i decided to make an online store where people can buy genuine products. I also wanted to give a platform to small businesses so that they can sell their products online.

Project detail:
        This project is made using MERN stack. The front end is made using React js and the back end is made using Node js and Express js. The database used is MongoDB.
